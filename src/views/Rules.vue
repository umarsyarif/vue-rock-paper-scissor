      Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items,
      with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or
      ro-sham-bo) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which
      each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched
      hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and
      "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended,
      forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also
      indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally
      instead of being held upright in the air.
